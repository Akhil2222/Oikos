Junu Lee was the Valedictorian of the class of 2018 and the Executive Student Body President in the 2016-2017 and the 2017-2018 school year. He was enrolled in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, and served on its student organization. He also engaged with competitive mathematics outside of school and pursued a research project. In this interview, Junu discusses his experiences at Westwood, particularly those related to IB, and reflects on how his time helped him grow.
Of course there is a lot of pressure… to succeed… it’s not all about tests and grades… there’s a lot of other stuff.
Junu highlighted that his time at Westwood High School was great and taught him many soft skills that are important to him today (critical thinking, presentation skills, etc.). In particular, he considers the International Baccalaureate (IB) program vital to his high school experience because of its community aspect and its emphasis on knowing what it means to know. He advises current students to always focus on the long term and treating learning as an experience rather than an outcome.
