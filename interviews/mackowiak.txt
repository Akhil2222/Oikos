In high school, Mr. Mackowiak was very invested in journalism and basketball. He, after graduating college, was a part of the George Bush administration. He was also the head of the Travis County Republican party until he retired to focus on his family, and now leads as president of the Potomac Group.
And I hope, maybe I can encourage you guys as you graduate from Westwood in the future that you go find that teacher that meant that difference to you and make sure you understand how important it is.
Mr. Mackowiak, a person deeply involved, had his start in journalism at Westwood. He believes that the IB programme prepares students very well (IB was introduced at Westwood during his time there). He also believes that the teachers at Westwood are exceptional and passionate about what they want to teach, and deserve praise.
