In high school, Mr. Mackowiak was very invested in journalism and basketball. There, he met two teachers who set him up for success, Judy Gaines and Penny Smeltzer. He, after graduating college, was a part of the George Bush administration. He was also the head of the Travis County Republican party until he retired to focus on his family, and now leads as president of the Potomac Group.
And I hope, maybe I can encourage you guys as you graduate from Westwood in the future that you go find that teacher that meant that difference to you and make sure you understand how important it is.
Mr. Mackowiak, a person deeply involved, had his start in journalism at Westwood, and gives a good bit of credit to Westwood for starting him down his media career path. He feels that Westwood prepared him very well for college, but that the IB programme is incredible at preparing students for college and the real world with its very high standards. He notes that his teachers had pushed him and gave him the passion to learn, for whom he is grateful for, and encourages others to show gratitude to teachers like his.
