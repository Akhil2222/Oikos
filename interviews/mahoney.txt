Matthew Mahoney was a member of the Westwood Swim Team from 2011-2025, and he was the swim captain during his senior year. Mr. McBrearty, his swim coach, considers him to be one of the most interesting high schoolers he has ever coached. In his 20s, Matthew sailed all over the world and interacted with many different cultures and lived with many different small island tribes. Nowadays, Matthew owns a moving company and a lights company, and he seeks to expand his businesses.
While that [pressure and competitiveness] gets a negative connotation while you’re there.. I’m grateful that everyone there was such high achievers and the bar was set pretty high, ‘cause I think that shaped my thinking about my own life and what’s possible, and, what the expectation should be.
Matthew repeatedly emphasized that he reflects extremely positively on his time at Westwood, largely due to the continuity of his social circle, where he still stays in touch with many of his high school friends, particularly those on the swim team. In addition, he cites the rigor and competitiveness of Westwood as something very positive to his current life, stating that it “set the expectation.” Matthew also reflects on his experience in college, where he felt that he wasn’t doing anything meaningful that felt important to him, which he contrasts with his current life now, where his life is full of exploration and constant learning about everything that he comes across.
