What you set yourself you set yourself up for now is going to be your bedrock for your education for college and how you do in your careers
The interview is with Mr. Sparkman, the CEO of Sparkman Wealth Management. His firm focuses on helping clients grow their wealth for retirement by creating financial plans and utilizing a unique investment system that has doubled the S&P's returns this year. The company is preparing to release a book detailing its strategies. He attributes his current success and the rigorous nature of his business life—which requires him to absorb information quickly, make decisions, and manage time efficiently—to the demanding academic and extracurricular culture of Westwood High School.<br/>Reflecting on his time at Westwood, he describes it as an "absolute meat grinder" that nonetheless "over prepared" him for college. His activities included playing football and running track. He was involved in the Vica Club (web page creation) and co-founded the short-lived Scuba Club. He notes the extreme competitiveness of the school, citing that with a class rank, he was not in the top 50% despite having an A average, and that the top students had their grades recalculated to the thousandth degree to determine the valedictorian. He learned to cope with the challenges through organization and talking to teachers in off-hours. Although he initially planned to be a video game developer and worked at Blizzard Entertainment for five years, he realized the career path was incompatible with having a family, leading him to transition through being a realtor before becoming a financial advisor.<br/>Mr. Sparkman strongly believes he "learned more at Westwood than at [his] college" and would absolutely choose to go there again. He concludes with advice to current students, urging them to study hard because the foundation they set now will be the "bedrock for your education for college and how you do in your careers". He contrasts the success of his friends who worked hard (business owners, tech startup founders) with those who slacked off in high school and are still doing minimum-wage jobs.
